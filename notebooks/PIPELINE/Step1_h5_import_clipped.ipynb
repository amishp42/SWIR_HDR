    "This function should enable us to import image data from the IR VIVO in CILS at Northeastern University. It requires input of the directory path and experiment title. Confirm also that the parameter combinations are correct (these may change, but rarely, so data collected in various eras should all be consistent with the same excitation and emission designations). Details should be read in from the file names (excitation laser and emission filter selections) and metadata (exposure times) included with the original hdf5 file. Since it uses a model of darkcount values per exposure time based on averages of 100x darkcount images across a broad swath of exposure times, b.npy and Sd.npy must be present in the data folder of this directory in order to work effectively.\n",
    "This has been updated to:\n",
    "1) Use a model of darkcounts based on the equation DC = slope*time + bias to determine a pixel-by-pixel darkcount estimation. \n",
    "2) Store the darkcount-subtracted (denoised) images and exposure times as numpy arrays in a data folder with the experiment name included in the file name. This will ensure that the data only has to be imported once and can be used repeatedly and efficiently for subsequent analysis.\n",
    "3) Generate an accompanying report in PDF format so that the images that are included in the numpy arrays can be quickly visualized and the min/max pixel intensity can be checked.\n",

    "[240806 AMD moved h5_import1.ipynb and image_import.py to pipeline]\n",
    "\n",
    "240809 AMD made Step1_h5_import_clipped, which not only denoises the imported images (which is just dark current subtraction), but also clips the saturated region to the linear range. This is done by determining the linear range using a linearity_threshold on a pixel-by-pixel basis and clipping the high pixel values to this linear range; once the maximum is set, the exposure time-dependent dark current values are subtracted from each image, and the clipped image sets are saved as npy arrays."
